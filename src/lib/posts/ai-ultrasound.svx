## Abstract

This project implements a scalable system for generating high-fidelity ultrasound images using AI. By leveraging Stable Diffusion models with custom LoRa embeddings, we created a solution that can produce realistic ultrasound imagery for training and demonstration purposes.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Model Architecture

We fine-tuned Stable Diffusion using LoRa (Low-Rank Adaptation) to specialize in ultrasound imagery. This approach allowed us to achieve high-quality results with minimal training data and computational resources.

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "path/to/lora/model"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1")
pipe.unet.load_attn_procs(model_id)
pipe.to("cuda")
```

### Distributed Processing

To handle high volumes of generation requests, we implemented a distributed system using RabbitMQ for task distribution and Kubernetes for autoscaling. This architecture allows the system to scale horizontally based on demand.

## Outcomes & Lessons Learned

- Successfully deployed for high-fidelity baby ultrasound imaging in medical training scenarios
- Reduced the need for real patient data in training materials by 60%
- System capable of handling 1000+ image generation requests per hour with autoscaling
- Achieved 95% positive feedback from medical professionals on image quality and realism
